# U-Net Segmentation Training

This repository contains code for training a **U-Net model** for image segmentation.  
It supports **training/validation logging, checkpointing, and early stopping**.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- U-Net model for semantic segmentation
- Training and validation loops with logging
- **Metrics**: BCE Loss, Dice Score, IoU
- **Checkpoints**:
  - `last_model.pth`: saved every epoch (latest state)
  - `best.pth`: saved only when validation Dice improves
- CSV logging of training progress (`log.csv`)
- Early stopping support
